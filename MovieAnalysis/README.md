# Problem: Analyzing Movie Ratings

You have been provided with a dataset of movie ratings from a fictional movie review platform. The dataset includes the following columns:

    MovieID: A unique identifier for each movie.
    Title: The title of the movie.
    Genre: The genre of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
    UserID: A unique identifier for each user.
    Rating: The rating given by the user, on a scale of 1 to 5.
    Timestamp: The timestamp of when the rating was given.

# Task:

## Load the dataset: 
Start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Data Cleaning:
Check for and handle any missing values.

Convert the Timestamp to a readable date format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculate the average rating for each movie and identify the top 5 movies with the highest average rating.

Determine the distribution of ratings across all movies.

Find out which genre has the most movies.

Analyze how movie ratings have changed over time. (You can group by year or month)

## Advanced Analysis:
Identify the top 5 users who have rated the most movies.

Determine the most common rating given by users.

Find out if there is any correlation between the genre of a movie and its average rating.

## Visualization:
Create a bar chart showing the top 5 movies with the highest average rating.

Plot the distribution of ratings using a histogram.

Visualize the trend of movie ratings over time using a line chart.

Create a pie chart showing the distribution of movies across different genres.

## Optional:
If you have time, you can implement a simple recommendation system that suggests movies to a user based on their past ratings.
