# About
Collection of CTFs that I have created for UofL's ACM CTF or for fun that I have made public.

In the spirit of good sportsmanship, I trust those competing to not utilize anything in here to find the flag. This repo has been made public for credibility purposes and to demonstrate work I have done.

## LudicroCTF1
This is a simple enumeration ctf executable file based off the enumCTF1.py. The goal of this CTF is to find the flag hidden within the program.

Usage Warning: This program will create an infinite number of duplicate boxes every time the number button is pressed with the counter increasing. The only way to close these boxes is to find the flag or close it within Task Manager (it's only one task, not one for every box).
